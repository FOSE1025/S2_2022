# Week 11 SGTA (External Offering)

# Student feedback survey (15 minutes)

Please spend some time to complete the student feedback survey of FOSE1025. Your feedback is very important to us, it will help us improve the unit.

Read [these slides](https://ishare.mq.edu.au/prod/file/4fddda41-ac3c-4ba9-8cce-bf72d6db16f0/1/Student_SurveyReference_S2v2.pdf) for more information.


## Activity 1 - Reproducibility

In the exercises of this activity you will interact with the same system you will use for the reproducibility project. The reproducibility project has two steps and we will recreate them here. **Each step has a separate deadline.**

### 1.1 - Submit a Report (10 minutes + 5 minutes discussion)

Choose a task of your choice and write a set of instructions describing the task. For example, feel free to reuse/improve your submission to the [Achiever hurdle task](https://ilearn.mq.edu.au/mod/turnitintooltwo/view.php?id=6969594). Please submit your own work, do not copy and paste instructions from the Web, so that you have a chance to practice your skills on writing reports for reproducibility.

**Do not submit the reproducibility report associated with your project.**

### 1.2 - Peer reviewing (10 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

Use the interface to review at least two reports. In your review, focus on assessing the aspect of reproducibility. In particular, ask yourself this question:

* With the information given in the report, would I be able to reproduce the task?

## Participation Task 1

This week's participation task is the submission of your reviews in Activity 1.2. Submit at least 2 reviews in the workshop activity with name "SGTA Peer Review of Reproducibility". 

## Activity 2 - Identify the version of Excel, MATLAB, and your operating system (10 minutes + 5 minutes discussion)

An important piece of information that you need to provide when you write a report for reproducibility is the version of your software and your operating system. This way other people can determine whether your instructions would apply to their setup. **You will need to provide this information in your assessed report for reproducibility, so make sure that you know how to find and report it.**

Write down the version of Excel and MATLAB installed in your computer and the details of your operating system. For example, my versions are:

* Excel: Microsoft Excel Online
* MATLAB: MATLAB Online, Version 9.13.0.2065095 (R2022b)
* Operating system: Linux Ubuntu 22.04

The following links can help you identify this information.

* [Version of Excel - desktop](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19)
* Version of Excel Online: I could not find information about how to identify the version of Excel Online, so you can just say that the version is, well, Excel Online.
* [Version of MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/version.html)
* Version of your Operating System
  * [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running)
  * [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201260)
  * [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckingYourUbuntuVersion)

## Activity 3 - Hypothetical ethics case study (15 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)


Below is a hypothetical case. Read the case and answer the questions below. In your answers, do not just say "yes" or "no". Also, justify the answer.

> You need to determine the attitudes of Australians with respect to the use of online learning tools. Since you do not have much time, you decide to gather a collection of tweet posts made available by Twitter and use it for your research. This collection is public, anybody can use it, but it is a small portion of all tweets posted by people worldwide. Twitter allows people to store the tweets collected for personal use but forbids them to distribute the tweets to other people.

1. If we stored the tweets in our local computers, would there be any issues related to privacy or security?
2. If we stored the tweets in the cloud, would there be any issues related to privacy or security?
3. This scenario has issues regarding fairness. Discuss the nature of these issues.
4. Are there any issues related to disclosure?


## Participation task 2

Submit your answers to activity 3 in the SGTA participation task submission box. After submission, show your result to your tutor so that your attendance can be recorded.

## OPTIONAL Activity 4 - Optus

In 2022, the media reported on data breach of Australia's Optus. Discuss how this case relates to the key ethical concerns with data that we are covering in this unit.
